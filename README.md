🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization
📘 Overview

This project explores and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.
Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers insights about total cases, deaths, testing rates, vaccination progress, and government responses across different continents.

🎯 Objectives

• Identify which continents reported the highest total cases and deaths.
• Analyze testing and vaccination trends.
• Compare positivity rates and stringency levels across continents.
• Highlight the top 10 countries most affected by COVID-19.
• Visualize relationships between cases, deaths, and tests.

🧰 Tools & Libraries

• Pandas — for data cleaning and analysis
• Matplotlib — for plotting and layout customization
• Seaborn — for advanced visualizations
• Python — for overall analysis workflow

📂 Dataset

• Source: Kaggle (COVID-19 Dataset)
• Description: Contains worldwide statistics including total cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing data, and policy responses.
• Key Columns: total_cases, total_deaths, total_tests, positive_rate, people_fully_vaccinated, stringency_index, continent, location, population

🔍 EDA Highlights

1. Continent-wise Cases & Deaths
Compared total cases and deaths across continents using visualizations.
Revealed large variations in how the pandemic affected different regions.

2. Vaccination Progress
Showed the difference in vaccination rollout speed across continents.

3. Testing & Positivity Rates
Explored how testing levels and positivity rates were related.

4. Government Response
Analyzed the average stringency index for continents to understand how strict policies impacted the spread.

5. Top 10 Countries Affected
Highlighted the most affected countries by total cases and deaths using charts and visual summaries.

6. Correlation Heatmap
Presented a clear picture of how different features, like testing and deaths, were correlated.

📈 Visualizations Included

• Line plots for total cases and deaths
• Bar charts comparing continents
• Scatter plots for relationships between factors
• Heatmap for correlations
• Pie chart for top 10 affected countries

🧹 Data Cleaning

• Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
• Removed irrelevant columns like population density and median age
• Grouped data by continent for comparison

🧠 Key Insights

• Continents with higher testing rates often had lower death rates.
• Some continents reported high deaths despite fewer cases, suggesting healthcare differences.
• Vaccination coverage varied significantly across regions.
• Stricter government policies helped control case growth in several areas.
